Hi, I’m Ikechukwu Ofili
I am a Computer Engineering major at The University of Texas at Arlington
I’m interested in Computer hardware design, systems programming, and IoT/Networking
I’m currently learning Computer hardware design and FPGA programming
I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to low level programming (I am currently writing a compiler for the Brainf\*ck esoteric programming language for all platforms possible)
